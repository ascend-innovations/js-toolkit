# @ascend-innovations/eslint-config-ts

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes

- d01998d: ## WHAT
  - Typescript configs used to be part of the `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` package. They are now being published independently here!
  - This package actually extends `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` and provides targeted overrides for Typescript files.
  
  ## WHY
  - We write a lot of Typescript and having the Typescript ESLint config on its own gives us more power and flexibility for these configurations.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d01998d]
  - @ascend-innovations/eslint-config@1.0.0
