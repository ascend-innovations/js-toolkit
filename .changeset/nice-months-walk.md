"@ascend-innovations/eslint-config-ts": major

## WHAT
- Typescript configs used to be part of the `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` package. They are now being published independently here!
- This package actually extends `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` and provides targeted overrides for Typescript files.

## WHY
- We write a lot of Typescript and having the Typescript ESLint config on its own gives us more power and flexibility for these configurations.
