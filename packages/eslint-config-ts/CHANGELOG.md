### Major Changes

- d01998d: ## WHAT

  - Typescript configs used to be part of the `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` package. They are now being published independently here!
  - This package actually extends `@ascend-innovations/eslint-config` and provides targeted overrides for Typescript files.

  ## WHY

  - We write a lot of Typescript and having the Typescript ESLint config on its own gives us more power and flexibility for these configurations.
